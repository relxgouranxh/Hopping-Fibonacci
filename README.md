# Hopping-Fibonacci
🔹 Basic Idea

1)This program simulates the growth of a rabbit population using the Fibonacci sequence.

2)Each number in the sequence represents rabbit pairs in a particular month.

3)Growth starts small and increases over time, mimicking natural reproduction patterns.

🔹 Rules Users Should Know

Input Rule:

User must enter a positive integer for the number of months.

Example: 10 → simulates 10 months of growth.

Growth Rule:

Month 1 → 1 pair of rabbits

Month 2 → 1 pair of rabbits

Month 3 onwards → Population = previous 2 months’ sum

Visualization Rule:

Each rabbit pair is shown as 🐇 (or ? if terminal doesn’t support emoji).

If population is too large for display, program shows “…” and prints total population at the end.

🔹 Tips for Users

Start with small numbers (e.g., 10 months) to see the growth clearly.

For larger months (e.g., 20+), program automatically limits visual symbols to avoid long lines.

This is a simulation for learning purposes, not an exact real-world prediction.

* With this project, you not only understand Fibonacci patterns, but also gain confidence in turning real-world problems into code. * 🚀
